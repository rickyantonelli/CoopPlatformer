This is an Online Co-Op Game in Unreal Engine using C++ and blueprints (codename Nova) - currently in development.

### General Idea:
- This is an online co-op platformer centered around mechanics and puzzle-solving
- Players can pass a ball back and forth, where the ball grants special abilities
- The ball can be used to overcome mechanics (resetting the player's jump in mid-air is the core mechanic), and it can also be used as a key to solve puzzles (ball needs to travel through a key hole to unlock a door)
- All art in this game is placeholder, we do not own it, and it will not be used for commercial release.
